# Valentine Letter

## Images
The `jpg` files are reflected horizontally so as to be seamless horizontally. The `png` files have transparency so that they will blend nicely with the `jpg` files.

## JavaScript
Function `getTimeBg()` uses `topbg_day.jpg` and `middlebg_day.png` for the backgrounds if time is between 7am to 7pm, and `topbg_night.jpg` and `middlebg_night.png` otherwise.

## CSS
- The CSS animation moves the top `jpg` files horizontally in an infinite loop.
- Other divs have layout stylings to superimpose the poem on top of the animated background.
